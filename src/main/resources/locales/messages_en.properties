output.radio.cbr=Constant bitrate, kb/s
output.radio.vbr=Variable bitrate, Quality
output.button.delete_preset=Delete Preset
output.tooltip.presets=Select one of the existing presets or create the new one just typing in the name. Presets hold combination of output parameters for different needs.
output.tooltip.formats=Select output format for audiobook. The most compatible is m4b, which will use aac encoding. Ogg format will use the more effective codec "opus", but may not be supported by your bookplayer.
output.tooltip.split=Default option is split by parts, normally book has one part only, so you will have one resulting audiobook file.\nYou can break book into several parts in "chapters mode", in case your book is very large or you want to break book series by parts. \nAs a result you will have several output files for the book, this might be needed if you have limited space on your device or your device is slow operating such large book.\nSplitting by chapters will result separate output file for each chapter, most common scenario is converting m4b audiobook into set of mp3 splitting by chapters.
output.tooltip.speed=Change speed of audiobook during encoding, note\: this most likely impact the size (faster - smaller size) and quality of audiobook, unless you tune other parameters to mitigate this.
output.tooltip.sampling_frequency=22 kHz is technically sufficient for most of the audiobooks, using a higher sampling rate such as 44.1 kHz or 48 kHz is generally recommended to ensure better audio quality especially for sound effects or music.\nLower sampling frequencies will give nearly linear savings on size. Higher frequencies will not give noticeable results for most of the users. \nRemember\: sound frequency range will be twice lower than sampling frequency range, e.g. with sampling frequency of 22kHz, maximum frequency range will be limited with 11kHz.
output.tooltip.cut_off=Removes frequencies higher than cut-off value.
output.tooltip.channels=Number of audio channels, default 2 - Stereo. Setting 1 channel - Mono, will reduce quality and size
output.tooltip.reencode=Shall program to force re-encoding? \nAuto - will let program decide if source file encoded with the same codec, program will just repack audiotracks into audiobook. Note\: quality settings will be ignored as audio stream reused as is.\nAlways - will force program to re-encode even if codec is the same, quality settings will be respected.\nAvoid - will try to skip re-encoding for compatible codes within the same format\: e.g. aac and alac in m4b, opus and vorbis in ogg.
output.tooltip.cbr=Switch to Constant Bit Rate mode. This mode allows to predict size of output file, however, with low bitrates you won't be able to predict quality.
output.tooltip.vbr=Switch to Variable Bit Rate mode. This mode allows to predict quality, however, size of resulting can be different depending on source track quality and complexity.
output.tooltip.bitrate=Higher bitrate - higher the quality and bigger the size. For most of the m4b books with aac codec -  64kb/s will be sufficient. Go for higher numbers if you have music and effects.
output.tooltip.vbr_quality=1 is lowest and 5 is the highest. There is no standard definition of quality between codecs. So, exact quality will depend on multiple factors, but should stay consistent for the duration of the book.
output.tooltip.delete_preset=Remove preset which is no longer needed.
